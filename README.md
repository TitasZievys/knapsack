# knapsack
This is a knapsack problem program that was used for my Extended Essay which is attached below. It was created to see how elitism could reduce the generation count needed to solve the problem while using roulette wheel selection.
You choose the parameters of the knapsack in the main function:

(line 6 in Main.java)
```
Knapsack knapsack = new Knapsack(100, 20); // (knapsackWeightCapacity, numberOfItems)
```

(line 8 in Main.java)
```
for(int i = 0; i<50; i++) // 50 is the population size
```

Now with having more experience, I can see what project lacks: comments, more commits, etc.

I choose to keep it this way so it fully represents the program that I did for the time. (In the future I may create another repository with the updated version)

The latest commits were pushed much later than the code was actually written since begginer me didn't understand the importance of version control. And so I didn't push the final version when I completed my project.

Some commit messages were in Lithuanian, so I changed them to be as accurate as possible with the small ammount of commits that I did at the time.
